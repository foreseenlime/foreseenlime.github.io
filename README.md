i made this website to showcase any html + css + js projects that i actually finish

the robotics website was made for my y11 digital tech assessment, which was to make a website for a club in our school
a lot of the stuff from the robotics website was taken from the old (official) website for the club
the sponsors listed in the 'support' page are (to my knowledge) no longer sponsor us, they were simply put there to have something on the page

link to repo for old website: https://github.com/SymbiOHSis/symbiohsis.github.io

the clicker game was made in about a week, just to fill the time spend between final assessments for y10 and the end of the year
it was heavily inspired by another game i had found online, that i changed a bit, but it is still very similar

anything in this website is free to use for your own stuff and/or modify, as long as it doesn't get profited off
credit/acknowledgement would be greatly appreciated for anything used, especially logos/emblems from our school and club
