## Hello!<br>
### I made this website to showcase any web projects that I actually finish<br>
### Anything used on the website here is linked below under the project it was used in<br>

### Important stuff<br>
Anything in this website is free to use for your own stuff and/or modify, as long as it doesn't get profited off<br>
Credit/acknowledgement would be greatly appreciated for anything used, especially logos/emblems from our school and club<br>
If necessary for any reason, please reach out to me at: troyhkiwi@gmail.com<br>

### Robotics website<br>
The robotics website was made for my year 11 digital tech assessment, which was to make a website for a club in our school<br>
A lot of the stuff from this robotics website was taken from the old (official) website for the club<br>
The sponsors listed in the 'support' page are (to my knowledge) no longer sponsor us, they were simply put there to have something on the page<br>

### Clicker game<br>
The clicker game was made in about a week, just to fill the time spend between final assessments for year 10 and the end of the year<br>
It was heavily inspired by another game I had found online, that I changed a bit, but it is still very similar<br>

I put some small easter eggs in this website, see if you can find them!
